# MyPetVenues Project Memory

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST - DO NOT SKIP

**Before assuming ANY code exists, you MUST verify the actual state:**

```powershell
# Run this FIRST to check if MyPetVenues folder exists
Test-Path "MyPetVenues"
```

**WHY:** VS Code search indexing may show code excerpts from other branches, git history, or stashes. These excerpts DO NOT reflect the current branch state. The workspace structure in `<workspace_info>` is the SOURCE OF TRUTH.

**RULE:** If the workspace structure does NOT list `MyPetVenues/` as a folder → the app does NOT exist yet → proceed with building.
