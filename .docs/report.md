## ⚡ Efficiency Analysis

| Metric | Sequential (Est.) | Parallel (Actual) | Savings |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Time** | (time) | (time) | (percentage) |
| **Agent Calls** | (count) | (count) | (percentage) |

### Visual Timeline
```
Sequential (if done one at a time):
[== Task 1 ==][== Task 2 ==][== Task 3 ==]
                                          ← Total: X minutes

Parallel (swarm mode):
[== Task 1 ==]
[== Task 2 ==]
              [== Task 3 ==]
                            ← Total: Y minutes (Z% faster!)
```
