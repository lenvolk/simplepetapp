# Product Requirements Document: PetSpots

## Overview

PetSpots is a community-driven platform that helps pet owners discover, share, and review pet-friendly locations. Think of it as a "Yelp meets Meetup" specifically designed for the pet owner community.

## Problem Statement

Pet owners often struggle to find reliable information about which locations welcome their furry companions. Current solutions are fragmented across general review sites that don't focus on pet-specific amenities and needs.

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Pet owners (dogs, cats, and other companion animals)
- **Secondary**: Pet-friendly business owners looking to attract pet owners

## Core Features

### 1. Location Discovery
- Search for pet-friendly locations by type (parks, restaurants, hotels, stores, etc.)
- Filter by pet type, amenities, and distance
- Map-based and list-based browsing
- Location details including hours, contact info, and pet policies

### 2. Add Locations
- User-submitted locations with verification workflow
- Categorization by location type
- Pet-specific amenity tagging (water bowls, outdoor seating, off-leash areas, etc.)
- Photo uploads

### 3. Reviews & Ratings
- Star ratings for overall pet-friendliness
- Detailed reviews covering pet-specific experiences
- Amenity-based ratings (cleanliness, staff friendliness, space, etc.)
- Photo reviews
- Helpful/upvote system for reviews

### 4. User Profiles
- Pet profiles (name, type, breed, size)
- Saved/favorite locations
- Review history
- Badge/reputation system for active contributors

## Success Metrics

- Monthly Active Users (MAU)

## Future Considerations

- Social features (follow other pet owners, meetup events)
- Business claiming and management portal
- Mobile app (iOS/Android)
- Integration with pet services (groomers, vets, pet stores)

## Technical Considerations

- Web-based responsive application
- Location/mapping services integration
- User authentication and profiles
- Image storage and optimization
- Search and filtering capabilities

## Out of Scope (v1)
